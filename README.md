# üöó Colorado Motor Vehicle Sales Forecasting üìä

This project presents a comprehensive analysis and forecasting model for quarterly motor vehicle sales across counties in Colorado. It aims to uncover sales trends, assess seasonality, and predict future sales using time series modeling. The data is visualized using Python and Tableau to support strategic business or policy decisions.

## üìà Python Analysis & Modeling

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning & Aggregation**  
   Converted year & quarter to a datetime format, aggregated total sales per quarter.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualized trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. **Seasonal Decomposition**  
   Performed to identify trend and seasonal components.

4. **ARIMA Forecasting Model**  
   - ARIMA(5,1,0) fitted to time series
   - Forecasted the next 8 quarters of sales
   - Evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE):  
     `7.82e+16`

## üìä Tableau Dashboard

The project includes a Tableau visualization dashboard with:
- Quarterly sales trends over time
- County-level comparison
- Filters for year, quarter, and county
- Forecasting using Tableau's built-in model

## üìå Results & Takeaways

- Vehicle sales exhibit clear seasonal trends (peaking in Q2‚ÄìQ3).
- ARIMA model provides a reliable sales forecast.
- Tableau dashboard offers an interactive view for business users.
- The project supports economic insights and inventory planning strategies.

## üîç Future Improvements

- Incorporate external factors (e.g., fuel prices, population growth)
- Explore advanced ML models like XGBoost, SARIMA
- Add predictive segmentation by county
